    "This solution implements an advanced fact-checking feedback mechanism for AI-generated summaries using LangGraph on Amazon Bedrock. The process begins with an AI model summarizing a given document. The summary then undergoes an evaluation loop where individual claims are extracted and verified against the original text. If any conflicts are found, the system provides specific feedback to the AI, prompting it to revise the summary. This cycle continues for a set number of iterations or until a faithful summary is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is particularly useful in scenarios where accuracy and faithfulness to source material are crucial, such as in report generation in business settings, academic research, or legal document summarization. It helps mitigate the risk of AI hallucinations or misrepresentations by implementing a self-correcting mechanism. This method not only improves the quality of AI-generated content but also provides transparency in the summarization process, which is valuable in building trust in AI systems for critical applications."

    "It begins with an input document fed into a Summarizer, which produces a summary using a specific prompt. This summary then moves to the Evaluator stage, where it undergoes two steps: first, a Claim Extractor extracts key claims from the summary, and then an Evaluator prompt assesses these claims against the original document. If the evaluation determines the summary is faithful to the original content, the process concludes successfully, outputting the verified summary. \n",

    "The summarization process incorporates a feedback and evaluation loop that iterates up to a predefined number (N) of attempts. The system strives to generate a faithful summary within these iterations. If a faithful summary is achieved at any point, the process concludes successfully. However, if after N attempts a faithful summary has not been produced, the process terminates with a fail response, clearly indicating that the goal was not met. This approach prioritizes accuracy over completion, opting to acknowledge failure rather than provide an unfaithful summary. It ensures that any summary output by the system meets a high standard of faithfulness to the original document.\n",

It demonstrates a practical way to improve AI summaries and make them more trustworthy.\n",
